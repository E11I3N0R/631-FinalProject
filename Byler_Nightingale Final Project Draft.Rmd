# \textcolor{WildStrawberry}{INTRODUCTION}


## \textcolor{TealBlue}{What:}

I would like to explore recreating data visualizations based on Florence Nightingale's pioneering work in the field in an R Shiny dashboard.

## \textcolor{TealBlue}{Why:}

Florence Nightingale is arguably the mother of data viz, and it would be interesting to see what sort of modern data visualizations I can create using her historical data.

## \textcolor{TealBlue}{How:}

I will use R Shiny to create a (hopefully interactive) dashboard with data visualizations using Florence Nightingale's dataset. The dataset is available here:   https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/HistData/Nightingale.csv

## \textcolor{TealBlue}{Minimal:} 

I would like to create an R Shiny dashboard with a recreation of the original rose diagram (see image below) and one or two other examples of the same data using different chart formats (e.g. bar and line).

## \textcolor{TealBlue}{Ambitious:} 

Ideally, I would like to accomplish all of the above, plus add more visualizations for other aspects of the dataset using at least three different interactive Shiny tools/widgets (https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html). I'd like to include a relevant discussion of Florence Nightingale's contributions to data viz and how historical best practices for visualizations compare to modern ones.

# \textcolor{WildStrawberry}{BODY}

### *Florence Nightingale's Original Rose Diagram & Explanatory Text:*

DIAGRAM of the CAUSES of MORTALITY in the ARMY in the EAST

Figure 1: APRIL 1854 to MARCH 1855  
Figure 2: APRIL 1855 to MARCH 1856

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rose_Diagram.jpg")
```

* The areas of the \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{blue}, \textcolor{Sepia}{red}, & black wedges are each measured from the center as the common vortex.
* The \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{blue} wedges measured from the center of the circle represent area for area the deaths from \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{Preventable or Mitigable Zymotic diseases}, the \textcolor{Sepia}{red} wedges measured from the center the deaths from \textcolor{Sepia}{wounds}, & the black wedges measured from the center the deaths from all other causes.
* The black line across the \textcolor{Sepia}{red} triangle in Nov. 1854 marks the boundary of the deaths from all other causes during the month.
* In October 1854 & April 1855, the black area coincides with the the \textcolor{Sepia}{red}, in January & February 1856, the \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{blue} coincides with the black.
* The entire areas may be compared by following the \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{blue}, the \textcolor{Sepia}{red}, & the black lines enclosing them.
